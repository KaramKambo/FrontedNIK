## Player Selection Screens
Make a lesson and code around a leaderboard.  Explain or try ideas so they can be adapted to the Teacher's project. 

Start a leaderboard on the start and game-over screen. Use local storage to record gameplay sessions, automatically at first. Time and points by level could be used as stats.

Leaderboard Integration
Create a leaderboard system that records time and points for each game session.

Allow players to review and filter the leaderboard.

Start Screen
Add features to start screen(s) to allow things like â€¦
- Leaderboard and Statistics
- Provide an option to reset or clear statistics

Game over Navigation Options
- Add name or initials and score to the leaderboard
