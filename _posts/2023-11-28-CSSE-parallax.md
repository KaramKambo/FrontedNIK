## Parallax and Scrolling Effects
Make a lesson and code around Parallax.  Integrate ideas so they can be adapted by the Teacher project.  Add elements to improve transitions screens and backgrounds.  Below are a couple of ideas, but there should be many more.

- Use a transition effect to smoothly move from the start screen to the game screen, etc.

- Overlaying Backgrounds
  - Implement a dual-layered background system where the primary background is static, and a passive background moves to create a parallax effect.
  - Adjust the opacity or blending mode to avoid shadows of the player moving over the screen.  Discuss how this works.

- Association with Character Movement
  - Synchronize the screen scrolling speed with the player's movement speed.
  - Consider incorporating easing functions for a smoother scrolling effect.

- Transition Screen
  - The start screen could have things to select levels for the Game or Competition in Multiplayer (Groups)
  - The end screen could be more focused on results automatically.
