    "\n",
    "A color in a computing application is represented by an RGB triplet that describes the amount of red, green, and blue, respectively, used to create the desired color. A selection of colors and their corresponding RGB triplets are shown in the following table. Each value is represented in decimal (base 10).\n",

    "#### What is a binary triplet?\n",
    "A binary triplet is a set of three binary numbers. Binary numbers are numbers that are represented by a series of 1's and 0's. Binary numbers are used in computers because they are easy to represent with electrical signals. A binary triplet is a set of three binary numbers that are used to represent a color. The first number represents the amount of red in the color, the second number represents the amount of green in the color, and the third number represents the amount of blue in the color. The numbers are represented in binary because it is easy to represent with electrical signals. The numbers are represented in a triplet because it is easy to represent with electrical signals.\n",

The first number represents the amount of red in the color, the second number represents the amount of green in the color, and the third number represents the amount of blue in the color. The numbers are represented in binary because it is easy to represent with electrical signals. The numbers are represented in a triplet because it is easy to represent with electrical signals. An example of this would be: (01101110, 11111111, 10010110), if you converted this binary triplet to a decimal number it would be 110, 255, 150. This would be a shade of the color green.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do you convert a binary triplet to a decimal number?\n",
    "To convert a binary string to a decimal number you need to multiply each digit by its place value. For example, if you have the binary string 1010 you would multiply the first digit by 2^3, the second digit by 2^2, the third digit by 2^1, and the fourth digit by 2^0. This would give you the decimal number 10. To convert a binary triplet to a decimal number you need to multiply each digit by its place value. For example, if you have the binary triplet (01101110, 11111111, 10010110) you would multiply the first digit by 2^7, the second digit by 2^6, the third digit by 2^5, the fourth digit by 2^4, the fifth digit by 2^3, the sixth digit by 2^2, the seventh digit by 2^1, and the eighth digit by 2^0.

IF you want to return the result and get a correct answer, multiplying 2,-5 and -2,-5 will give you the wanted result.
