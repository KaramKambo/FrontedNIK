<h2> Test Corrections </h2>

<h2> (1) Cause of Overflow Error </h2>
- I got this question wrong as I did not properly understand the definition of an overflow error. During the quiz, I looked it up and thought that the definition Google provided me with implied that overflow is a result of integers being stored in decimal forms which results in a rounding error. Now that I think about it, the term "overflow" implies that the computer/machine is unable to store something which is more in line with the correct answer. The correct answer as written on CollegeBoard is that an overflow error occurs becasue "the program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers and the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value." This definition explained to me what an overflow error meant and I know understand that these errors occur due to the results of arithmetic operations being outside the range of numbers that are able to be represented by a specified number of bits. To make sure I don't repeat this mistake, I will watch the Daily Videos reccomended by CB for this question. 

<h2> (2) Science Museum Tickets </h2>
- This question was a simple mistake on my part. I should have been more careful in interpreting the code. The reason my answer option was wrong was due to the if conditional contained both the age and includesTour variables where it instead should have created two separate if conditionals. The table in the problem had stated how if the child was older than 12, the general admission cost was 8 dollars whereas the guided tour cost was 10 dollars. From this, we can easily see that

## Reflection

There were seveeral questions on the quiz that required me to translated the "code" which was written in either a graphical mechanism or in text to the result it would output. I think that depsite me getting a majority of these questions right, I struggled with them the most as it was difficult to picture the code in my head. Additionally,
